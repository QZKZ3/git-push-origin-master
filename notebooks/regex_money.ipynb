I wanted to finish my contract quickly. Once there were more girls, I did not have to work as much and the owner decided to move me to another place, which was where I was arrested. At this place, I had to put up with all kinds of customers. They were all drunk and stupid. I had to do everything they wanted. At first, I could not stand it. I went back to the first place because one of the girls who had come here a month before me had finished her contract. At the time, the owner of the parlor was going to the US. At first she told me that she would take me back to the second place to work and I just had to let her do that. She let me go back, however, when one of my regular customers was going to spend the night. When I came back the next day, she told me that she would like me to finish my contract fast and she would take me to her friend’s parlor in the Sheppard area. I had no objection. She could do anything to me because I wanted to finish the contract as soon as possible. However, instead of taking me to her friend’s, she sold me to a Thai girl who had a Vietnamese boyfriend, in Mississauga. I could not stand staying there because I did not have enough customers. After two or three days, I could not stand it anymore. At the time I owed $12,000 more. It took seven or eight days before my former boss bought me back. The boss bought me for $10,000 and wanted $2000 from me. Every day, I had to work. I had no time to rest even when I had my period. Sometimes when I got really tired, she asked her boyfriend to take me to her place for some sleep. I could not sleep at the massage parlor because the owner had fights with her boyfriend. I had to put up with my circumstances because I owed them money. If I finished paying her back I could leave. I had to work every day because they forced me to. I had to have my period in one day; I had to take three or four birth control pills per day. Actually, I did not want to work at all. When I told her that I hurt, and where, she still made me work without stopping. I had to be patient and I never had a fight with her. The owner was a workaholic. If we did not have enough customers on any day, she would start to complain and use abusive language saying that I did not do a good job. I just had to be patient and listen to her. When we had lots of customers, she was happy and went out with her boyfriend, but when they came back, they started fighting again. One day I woke up early in the morning to launder my clothes at a place near my work. On that day, the owner of my massage parlor went out to advertise our phone number—that hadn’t been done for one to two months. At that house, one of my friends was making a dish called “Kanom Jeen Man Nguew.” That day the house was strangely quiet. I felt like going out; I did not want to stay at in this parlor. One of the reasons was that all day we had had only two customers. I worked for one and my friend worked for the other. The owner of the parlor, my friend and I played a card game. We finished the game. I was lying down on the sofa. There was a Vietnamese man who came to see the owner. This person was looking for a girl to work at his place. After the conversation was over with the owner, the Vietnamese man walked out the door. After about five minutes, there was somebody knocking on the door. The owner of the parlor opened the door and thought that it was a customer. She did not look through the cat door. That was the moment we were about to be arrested. It was about eight or nine at night. There was a middle aged Vietnamese-Chinese man who knocked on the door. She opened the door. As soon as she opened the door, the police, about ten of them, raided the place. They ordered us to be still and not move. The owner of the place turned very pale, like a boiled egg. Some of the policemen searched for evidence. They broke the glass windows in two rooms—the workroom and the room that the owner and I stayed in. The officers who restrained us shouted very loud saying that we should not do anything. My friend and I and the owner of the place sat on the sofa with our hearts sunk and lost. I told myself that I was arrested, and would accept the situation later on. The owner of the place could not control herself and cried.\\xa0 Narrative as told to the Toronto Network Against Trafficking in Women'"

       "\"You may have seen the video of black people being sold. But that's too late. You've only seen videos of 2017. What happened to the videos of 2013, 2012, 2014? They're not showing you that. Blacks being sold is hurtful, that's true. But believe me there’s worse than that. If I tell you there is worse than that, that's because I have been sold. I know what Libya is because I made it out of Libya. I spent a lot of time in Libya. I know Libya like the back of my hand. I was sold for $270. In a place called Sabha that many know. I worked for 6 months on a plantation. By God's grace I was able to escape. But it wasn't over. I escaped one hellhole to embrace another worse one. I fled Sabha for Bangali. I was kidnapped by a group of rebels. The rebel leader was Abdul Karim. All who’ve been through Bangali know this man. This man has over 350 African women in captivity at this very moment. The men I can’t even count. The whip was a everyday thing. The electric wire on your body. We were over 1000 people in Abdoul Karim captivity. By God’s grace I escaped alone. In 2016. When I escaped, I couldn’t help my brothers that were still locked up. I can’t complain to anyone because everyone is in the same migrant trade. When NGOs come visit blacks in prisons, they dress you up in Adidas outfits to give the impression that you’re doing well in prison. There’s not one migrant that going to speak or else it’s your death. They come under the pretext of deporting you but they will never deport. They’re a business between NGOs and Libya. It’s a very easy game. The Libyan navy that’s supposed to support you and show you hospitality by deporting you to your respective countries. That same Libyan navy, rescue you at sea and resale you to other rebels that torture you and force your family to send them money. I saw prisons in Libya five times. Why? If you’re caught while crossing the Mediterranean Sea, it’s the beginning of your worst nightmare. You don’t even have enough to eat. You go out to find something, you’re kidnapped. It’s not easy! It’s the only country in the world that every Friday they sell weapons on the sidewalk. Kalashnikovs are sold for less than a dollar. Only in Libya. The young girls. If you see our African sister in Libya. The way that they’re being tortured!? In the prison in raskah, they make the men take off your clothes. They force you to sleep with your own brother! Your friend that you eat together, you have to sleep with him. If you don’t do it my brother, they break your legs with weapons. Our African leaders, you stay quiet with your mouth closed. That little video from CNN that you saw. That is painful, is turning the world upside down. If they show you the actual reality, it can set off a third world war. But we didn’t have phones at that time to film what was happening. There’s worse than selling blacks in Libya. There’s much worse! There’s much much worse than that! When I say much worse, believe me. I experiences Libya from the entrance to the exit. Time is of the essence we don’t even have a second to waste. Libyans have private prisons. Meaning that every Libyan built his own private prison.\\xa0 He can catch 15 to 20 to 40 migrants depending on how big his house is. Locks you up and forces you to pay. We don’t talk about people who are being kidnapped and held in private prisons. The Libyan state prisons, financed by Europe to stop migration of Africans in Europe. The same people catch migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, are the same people that resell them to rebels and submit them to slavery like you’ve seen. Make them work hard! Many Africans died. When Africans die at sea the corpse wash up on the shore in Souara, the city where I was living. No one is filming this. Here’s a very simple example. When they send 15-20 boats in the Mediterranean Sea, there might be seven boats that make it. What happened to the other boats? They all drowned! One boat hold 120 migrants at one time. Imagine if 15 boats were sent out. And only seven boats make it. Meaning eight boats drown at sea. If you multiply 120 migrants by eight boats it equals a lot of dead blacks. You know how that happens? You’ve never heard of African cemeteries in Libya. You never asked about the corpses of Africans that drowned in the Mediterranean. You’ve never understood the system. We pick up the blacks. It’s thousands of dead corpses. We dig a big hole, we dump the corpses inside the hole. We never cover the hole with dirt. Just to make the Africans believe that they were buried. It’s not done! That’s when the organ trafficking starts. That’s what it’s all about. Organ trafficking! They remove the essential organs before filling the hole. I know what I’m talking about. I’m not talking just to talk. I’m talking about what I experienced. What I saw with my own eyes. They decapitate the African’s bodies. They take the organs they need to sell to the westerners. There are American and French boats on sea. Under the pretext of extracting oil. It’s all business. It’s not oil. When you hear that there are 4 or 25 boats that sank at sea, what do you think happened to the bodies? No one’s talking about that. They’re millions of Africans who died in Libya. Some families think that they’re kids made it to Europe but it’s not so. You can’t even tell the family because you will break their hearts. I’m from Cameroon, I lost a lot of my friends. As I speak right now, many are still in jails. Jails that even African presidents can’t find because they’re underground. You need someone who knows the territory to expose these prisons. I can’t cry anymore, I’m tired of crying. We saw too many corpses. We thank all of you for the huge protests that you did for us today. It’s truly heartfelt. African leaders, if you come, if you don’t come, you’ve already exposed you guilt! But our brothers manifestations gives us hope to escape the hell we are facing. God always has the last word. I thank you.\""

       "'I looked for jobs here and there and eventually I got a job at the market. We decided to take a loan to buy a washing machine and a fridge. I worked at the market and sold household cleaning products. I started to suffer from allergies to the chemicals. My health was more important so I quit this job and registered at the state employment center. We had no money to make the repayments. With my husband at home, we started to have arguments “You don’t work!”, “You don’t work either!” “You wanted to take a loan. Now how will we pay? Think! The interests are growing.” They offered work as a retailer of Chinese goods at the wholesale market. The salary was for $500 - $600 (USD) a month. Accommodation and meals were free of charge. I asked her, “Can I go with you?” and she replied, “If you want to. You’re welcome.” So we went. There were four of us – my friend, two more people and I. A rather nice middle-aged man met us at the railway station. He wasn’t suspicious at all. He talked nicely with us, in a friendly normal manner. He said, “Girls! Don’t worry, everything is going to be alright. You’re gonna have a cool job, and will earn money!” We arrived at the wholesale market. He brought us to a large warehouse full of packages and giant bags with Chinese goods in them. An owner walked out and approached him. They talked about something, then that owner put about three bags in the vehicle. And then our guide said, “Alright, girls, I have to leave you now. If you don’t like something here, just let me know and I’ll come to pick you up. Don’t worry, everything will be fine.” There was a moment when one of our girls tried reaching the top shelf to get a bag with a specific tag. She lost her balance and fell down. These bags pressed her down. She was going to suffocate if we didn’t help her. Then we panicked. Because we thought today it was her, tomorrow it could be me. We talked about this to the owner and asked him to pay our weekly wage. We asked him to call the same person who brought us here, so that he take us away. He started making calls and talking to someone. In a few hours our guide arrived. “If you don’t like it here, get ready. I’ll take you to another place”. Finally, he brought us to the outskirts. There was an abandoned stock base there. Surrounded by a high fence. At this point he finally started to reveal his true character. He wasn’t smiling anymore. He said, “Get out! If you don’t, I’m gonna shoot!” He took out a gun and fired a shot into the air. We got out of the vehicle. What else could we do? They took us into a building to a tiny room. There were these wooden pallets and dirty mattresses of unknown origin on the floor. In the middle of the night two of these so-called guards came to us. Drunk. One said to me and another girl, “Come out.” Naturally, they forced us out of the room. They led us to a room where they had been drinking. They were looking for sex. We refused, of course, but they beat us up, tied us up and did what they wanted. It felt like being crushed, like you didn’t exist anymore. You’re not you, you’re nobody. They told us, “You still have to work off what we paid for you.” The next day we were taken to the work site. It was just a basement, which turned out to be an underground fake vodka distillery. Our task was to bottle the vodka, which they were producing, to stick on the labels. They didn’t even give us a minute to sit down, they were almost over us with whips. “Quicker and quicker.” We waited in terror until the end of working day, for night to come. Because they could come at any time and take us away, which would be putting it lightly. I ended up just saying, “Give me vodka.” So that I didn’t feel anything. We were hitchhiking. The trip back took three days, two nights of which we spent in the woods. Fortunately, we met some good, kind people who helped us cross the border, and we reached Ukraine. Then we travelled back home by commuter trains. As told to documentary makers at MTV Exit.'"
